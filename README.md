# Pi Viewcam
-------------------
This code enables a Raspberry Pi camera module to function as the digital back for a view camera. This implies the necessity of manual control.

## Core features
-------------------
* Manual control over Raspberry Pi camera module.
* Visual feedback and control via 3" PiTFT display

## TODO
-------------------
* make sure previews are running before capturing + 1+ seconds
* make sure previews stops after some time
* make settings adjustable
* make some way to switch between preview mode and review mode
* include a timer mode (set delay)
* incorporate rotary encoder (adjust LED colour to type of setting? flash during delayed capture)
* include a way to trigger a connected flash (if capture can be timed accurately)
* perhaps run a simple fileserver for remote access? -> can be separate
* turn off display during capture / set to black
* use PiTFT display for all visual feedback
* load settings from last time
* have a proper shutdown routine
